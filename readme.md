## Tictactoe C
This is the project made for Structured Programming & Interfacing assignment.

we are required to make a tic tac toe program with a graphical library written by one of our lecturer `gfx.c`.

## Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mfrashad/tictactoe_c.git
$ cd tictactoe_c
```
run this inside the project directory to compile.

This will compile everthing in `src` into `obj` folder and create a binary file in `bin` folder.
